# Contributing to Random Code Repo 🌀

Yo! 😎 Welcome to the chaos zone of random code. This repo is all about experimenting, learning, and storing snippets in multiple languages. If you want to contribute, here’s the lowdown:

---

## 1️ Issues & Ideas

- Got a bug? Some weird behavior? Or just a brainwave? Drop an **issue**.
- Include as much info as you can: what happened, expected vs actual, code snippets, or screenshots if needed.
- No stress if it’s small—typo fixes count too.

## 2️ Pull Requests (PRs)

We love seeing new code fly in. Keep it tidy:

1. **Fork the repo** and make a branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/cool-thing
   ```
2. **Add your code**, example, or snippet.
3. **Test** it if applicable.
4. **Commit with a clear message**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add Python snippet for xyz"
   ```
5. **Push** your branch
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/cool-thing
   ```
6. **Open a PR** to the main branch.

## Code Guidelines
- Keep it **readable**. Comments are your friend.
- One snippet per file is usually cleaner.
- Follow **language conventions** (PEP 8 for Python,   standard practices for C++, etc.).
- Don’t stress about perfection—we’re here to learn.

## Discussions
- Wanna suggest a new language folder? Or discuss a tricky snippet? Open an **issue** or **discussion**.
- Share ideas, ask questions, or just say hi 👋.

## Thank You 💖
- Whether it’s a tiny typo fix or a multi-language snippet, your contribution is appreciated.
Keep it random, keep it fun, and keep learning! 🚀
